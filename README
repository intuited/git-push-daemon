usage: git-push-daemon [OPTIONS]
Options:
  -f FILE	sources the profile stored in FILE.
         	This should contain assignments to git-push-daemon's environment variables in shell script format.
Uses these environment variables:
  GPD_REPO_DIR       	!    	the path to the repo to be pushed
  GPD_LOG_DIR        	!    	the directory to which events will be logged.
  GPD_REPO_REMOTE    	=NONE	the remote repository which the push should target, ie the <repository> argument to $(git push).
  GPD_LASTWIN_TIMEOUT	=0   	if this number exceeds the number of seconds since the last successful push, an error state will be returned.
Produces these return codes:
  0:    	the push was successful
  1-3,6:	indicate infrastructure issues
  4:    	shouldn't happen
  5:    	indicates timeout since last successful push.
  Non-zero return codes are accompanied by information and a state dump on stderr.
Logging details:
  All push failures are logged to $GPD_LOG_DIR/push-fails
  Push failures which occur within the timeout period do not result in an error state and are logged to $GPD_LOG_DIR/timely-push-fails
  All such event loggings consist of a timestamp and newline being added to the respective file.
  In the event of a successful push, the file $GPD_LOG_DIR/lastwin is replaced with the timestamp.
